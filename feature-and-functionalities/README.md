# 🏡 Airbnb Clone - Backend

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to build the backend infrastructure of an Airbnb-like rental marketplace. It will provide robust, secure, and scalable APIs that manage user interactions, property listings, bookings, payments, reviews, notifications, and administrative operations.

---

## 📚 Introduction

Backend development for the Airbnb Clone involves designing and implementing server-side logic, database schemas, API endpoints, and third-party integrations. This README outlines the **core functionalities**, **technical requirements**, and **non-functional requirements** necessary to build a world-class rental application backend.

---

## 🔑 Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management

- **User Registration**  
  - Users can sign up as **guests** or **hosts**.  
  - JWT-based secure authentication is implemented.

- **Login and Authentication**  
  - Login via **email and password**.  
  - Support for OAuth login (e.g., **Google**, **Facebook**).

- **Profile Management**  
  - Users can update their profile: photo, contact info, preferences.

---

### 2. Property Listings Management

- **Add Listings**  
  - Hosts can list properties with title, description, location, price, amenities, availability.

- **Edit/Delete Listings**  
  - Hosts can update or remove listings.

---

### 3. Search and Filtering

- Search properties by:
  - Location
  - Price range
  - Number of guests
  - Amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly, etc.)
- Support for **pagination** of large datasets.

---

### 4. Booking Management

- **Create Bookings**  
  - Guests can book available properties for selected dates.  
  - Date validation prevents double bookings.

- **Cancel Bookings**  
  - Guests or hosts can cancel according to policy.

- **Track Booking Status**  
  - Booking statuses: `pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`, `completed`.

---

### 5. Payment Integration

- Use secure gateways like **Stripe** and **PayPal**.
- Handle:
  - Guest payments.
  - Automatic host payouts post-booking.
- Support **multiple currencies**.

---

### 6. Reviews and Ratings

- Guests can leave reviews and 1–5 star ratings.
- Hosts may respond to reviews.
- Reviews are tied to bookings to prevent abuse.

---

### 7. Notifications System

- In-app and email notifications for:
  - Booking confirmations
  - Cancellations
  - Payment status updates

---

### 8. Admin Dashboard

Admins can monitor and manage:
- Users
- Listings
- Bookings
- Payments

---

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management

- Use **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.
- Core tables:
  - `users`
  - `properties`
  - `bookings`
  - `payments`
  - `reviews`

---

### 2. API Development

- Build **RESTful APIs** with:
  - `GET` for data retrieval
  - `POST` for creation
  - `PUT/PATCH` for updates
  - `DELETE` for removal

- **GraphQL** (optional but recommended) for optimized queries.

---

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

- Use **JWT** for user sessions.
- Apply **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for:
  - Guests
  - Hosts
  - Admins

---

### 4. File Storage (Scenario-based)

- Store media (property images, profile photos) using:
  - **Local file storage** (for development/demo)
  - **Cloud options** like AWS S3 or Cloudinary (for production)

---

### 5. Third-Party Services

- Use services like **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for email notifications.

---

### 6. Error Handling & Logging

- Implement **global error handlers** for API exceptions.
- Log errors and key events for debugging and monitoring.

---

## 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability

- Modular architecture for easy scaling.
- Enable **horizontal scaling** with load balancers.

---

### 2. Security

- Encrypt sensitive data like passwords and payment info.
- Use **firewalls**, **rate limiting**, and **secure headers**.

---

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Use **Redis** caching for frequently accessed data (e.g. search).
- Optimize database queries (indexes, joins, limits).

---

### 4. Testing

- Use `pytest` for **unit** and **integration tests**.
- Implement **automated API tests** to validate endpoints.

---

## ✅ Summary

This backend system forms the backbone of the Airbnb Clone, delivering the features, performance, and security required in a real-world rental platform. It prioritizes maintainability, scalability, and a great user experience for both guests and hosts.
